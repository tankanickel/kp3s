Firmware and Settings for my KP3S (former Kingroon, after all those changes itÂ´s something else)

Required Mods:
- Orbiter 2.0
- Activation of UART on all Stepper drivers
- V6 Hotend
- BL Touch / 3D Touch
- Linear Rails on Z-Axis
- EBB36 v1.2 Can Toolhead (I use 4 pins of the endstop connection + 1 of the dupont probe points (ground) for the 3d Touch)
